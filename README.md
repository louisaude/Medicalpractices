# README

This app was coded as for a calling cahllenge for a full stack position.

Things you may want to cover:
The stack is as follows:
Ruby 2.6.6
Rails 6
Bootstrap 4
SCSS
SQLite Database

As per the challenge's instructions, this app allows the user to create  Medical practices pages, add doctor hours and display them.

Due to time constraints, there is quite some room for improvement. Main points include:
1-Adding validations to models to avoid duplication, timeslots overlap
2-Adding flashes to deletion buttons
3-Cleaning up the SCSS and assets pipeline as the last bout of styling was very much a rush job.
